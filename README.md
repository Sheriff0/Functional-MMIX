# Functional-MMIX

The is an implementation of some of the operations in the instruction set of the virtual MMIX machine developed by Dr. Donald Knuth, with an F.P (Functional Programming) undertone.

All of the programs use another program called "bins.c" to print the bits after the operation. They refer to this program as "bins". So, to use any of the operations you need to first compile "bins.c" with the name "bins" ('gcc -o bins bins.c' on UNIX).
